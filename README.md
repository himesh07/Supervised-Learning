# Supervised Machine Learning of Adult Dataset

## Project Topic
### Task
Project task is to develop and evaluate binary classification models. The learning includes data cleaning, management, analysis, visualization, feature engineering, model development and improvement. The models of interest are Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
### Goals
Project goal is to deploy supervised machine learning models to the Adult dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository and evaluate the performance of the predictive algorithms. Secondary goals are to clean the data, run exploratory data analysis with statistical analyses and visualization, and iterate and improve the model performance. As this is a binary classification problem, feature engineering with proper metric evaluation would be important. These activities are crucial for any machine learning task and the subsequent skills development.
